The found interesting is that design has good and bad. 
# Chapter 1 – Reflection on *The Design of Everyday Things*

# Chapter 1 – Reflection on *The Psychopathology of Everyday Things*

In Chapter 1, Don Norman talks about how many everyday things are
confusing to use, like doors, websites, and machines. He says that
when people struggle with these things, it’s usually not their fault.
It’s because the **design is bad**, not the person.

Good design should make it easy to see what you can do and what will
happen when you do it. Norman calls this **discoverability** and
**understanding**. But when things don’t give clear signs, people get
confused and blame themselves. They think they did something wrong,
when really the product didn’t guide them well.

I felt this when I tried to **sell our minivan online**.  
The website was so confusing that I couldn’t even find a simple
category for cars. I didn’t know where my listing went or how to
answer messages. It made me feel like I was doing something wrong,
but now I understand it was just poor design. The website didn’t
match how most people think or look for things.

Another example is **corded headphones**.  
They tangle up so easily, and every time I try to untangle them I get
frustrated. I wish Apple made a version that could **retract** so the
cord wouldn’t get messy. That would make life easier and calmer.

# Chapter 2 – Reflection on *The Psychology of Everyday Actions*

In Chapter 2, Don Norman talks about how people do everyday things.
He says every action has steps: we decide what we want to do, plan it,
try it, see what happens, and decide if it worked. When something is
hard to do, it’s usually because the design doesn’t match how people
actually think or move. That makes us feel like the problem is us,
not the design.

I felt this when I was eating **biryani** at a restaurant.  
The food looked amazing—beautiful layers of rice and spices stacked in
a small shiny bowl filled right to the top. But when I tried to mix it,
it was almost impossible. The spoon was too thin and too short, and
the bowl was too full. I really wanted to enjoy it because the smell
was so good, but I ended up struggling, spilling rice, and feeling
frustrated. I thought, *“Why can’t I do this right?”* But after reading
Norman, I realized it wasn’t me—it was the **design**.

Norman says that when design makes it hard to do something simple,
people often blame themselves. Good design should make the next step
obvious and give us tools that fit what we want to do. In this case, a
**bigger bowl** and a **better serving spoon** would have made mixing
easy and the experience more enjoyable. The fancy look of the small
bowl ignored the real goal—being able to eat comfortably.

This chapter helped me see how much **emotion** is part of design.
When things work smoothly, we feel calm and happy. When they don’t, we
feel awkward or upset. That’s not a personal failure—it just means the
design didn’t think about people’s real needs.

**In short:**  
Good design helps people do things easily and feel good doing them.
Bad design gets in the way and makes people think they’re the problem,
even when they aren’t.

# Chapter 4 – Reflection on Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability,
and Feedback

In Chapter 4, Don Norman explains that good design helps people know
what to do and what not to do without needing a manual. He says this
happens through “constraints”—rules or limits that guide how we use
something. When designers use the right constraints, people can figure
things out safely and easily.

Norman talks about four kinds of constraints:

1. Physical constraints – the shape or size of something limits how
you can use it.
Example: a USB plug only fits one way.
2. Cultural constraints – things we learn from habits or society.
Example: red means stop, green means go.
3. Semantic constraints – clues from meaning or context.
Example: a cup handle is for holding, not stirring.
4. Logical constraints – reasoning that helps us know what makes
sense.
Example: the last puzzle piece can only go in one spot.

These ideas made me think about two programs I use: Unity and
Adobe XD

When exporting a project in Unity, you can choose any folder on your
computer. The problem is that Unity does not stop you from choosing a

folder that already has files in it. If you do, it will completely
overwrite that folder and delete your work. The warning message that
appears does not help much—it highlights “Yes” instead of “No.” It
doesn’t protect you from making a big mistake. This is a design with
“poor constraints” and misleading “feedback”. It lets users go down the
wrong path too easily.

Adobe XD, on the other hand, shows how good constraints and
signifiers work together. When you create a prototype (linking one
artboard to another), the next step is clear. The right button is
highlighted, and colors show which slide you are connecting to. It
feels smooth and easy because the design uses color and layout to show
the safest and most likely action. That is what Norman means by using
“signifiers” and “logical constraints”—they help people do the right
thing without guessing.

Comparing the two makes the lesson clear.
Unity’s design caused confusion and frustration because it didn’t guide
me or protect my work. Adobe XD made me feel confident because it gave
clear signals and feedback. Norman’s message is simple: good design
keeps people safe, confident, and focused on their goal.

In short:
Unity forgot to use constraints that stop mistakes.
Adobe XD used good constraints and signifiers to guide me the right way.
Good design should always help people know what to do next.

Questions to think about

1. Have you ever used software or a device that lets you make a big
mistake too easily? What kind of constraint could have prevented it?

2. Why do you think color and layout are so powerful as signifiers in
digital design?

3. Can you think of an example from real life (not software) where a
physical or logical constraint helped keep you from making an error?

# Chapter 4 – Reflection on *Constraints That Force the Right Behavior and Using
Sound as Signifiers*

In the last part of Chapter 4, Don Norman talks about how good design
can guide people to do the right thing and stop them from making
mistakes. He calls these built-in limits **forcing functions**. They are
rules that make sure people don’t do something harmful or confusing by
accident.

There are two main kinds of forcing functions:

- **Lock-in** – keeps you from leaving or quitting too early.
Example: when a computer asks, “Do you want to save before closing?”
- **Lock-out** – keeps you from doing something unsafe.
Example: a microwave that won’t start until the door is closed.

Norman says good design should use these limits to protect people.
Designers should think ahead about what could go wrong and add simple
steps that help users avoid big problems.

A real-life example for me is when I use **VS Code** to write
**JavaScript**. The editor usually shows syntax errors with a red line,
but it doesn’t catch all of them. Sometimes I paste or type code that
has a small mistake—like a missing parenthesis or bracket—and there’s
no warning. Then I run the code, and it doesn’t work, but I have no idea
why. I spend time searching line by line to find the error. This makes
me wish VS Code had a stronger **feedback system** that showed every

syntax error right away. It should highlight or “redline” all mistakes
before I run the code. That would act as a kind of **forcing function**,
stopping me from moving forward until I fix the problem. Instead, the
tool lets me fail silently, which can be really frustrating.

Norman also talks about **sound** as another kind of **signifier**—a
signal that tells us what’s happening. A click, beep, or chime can show
that something worked, or warn us when something’s wrong. For example,
a **smoke alarm** or **carbon monoxide detector** uses sound to warn us
of danger. Without that noise, people could be in serious trouble and
not even know it.

He also explains that quiet technology isn’t always a good thing.
Electric cars (EVs), for example, are so quiet that people who are blind
can’t hear them coming. Adding a small, gentle sound can make roads
safer. Sometimes, a little bit of noise is what keeps people alive.

Reading this made me realize that feedback—both visual and sound—is a
huge part of design. Good design communicates clearly, whether it’s a
red line on the screen or a sound in the real world. When feedback is
missing, people are left guessing, and that’s when frustration happens.

**In short:**
Good design should give clear feedback, use sound wisely, and stop
people from making avoidable mistakes. If we can see or hear what went
wrong, we can fix it faster and feel more confident using the product.

Some questions to think about
1. Have you ever used a program or device that didn’t warn you when
something was wrong? How did it affect your confidence or mood?
2. Why do you think feedback (like red lines, clicks, or sounds) makes
people feel safer and more in control?
3. Can you think of other times when silence or lack of feedback caused
confusion or mistakes?

# Chapter 5 – Reflection on *Human Error? No, Bad Design* (Part 1)

In Chapter 5, Don Norman explains that what we often call **human error**
is usually **bad design**. When people make mistakes, it’s not because
they are careless or lazy—it’s because the product or system didn’t
guide them clearly or help them recover. Norman says good design should
expect people to make slips and mistakes and make it easy to fix them.

He describes two main types of errors:
- **Slips** – when you mean to do the right thing but press or move the
wrong way.
- **Mistakes** – when you think you’re doing the right thing but
misunderstood how something works.

Good design helps people recover from both. That could mean adding an
**undo** button, showing a **warning message**, or saving your work
automatically so you don’t lose progress.

### My Reflection

As someone on the **high-functioning autism spectrum**, I deal with fine motor
challenges every day. One example is **belts**. I find it hard to line up
the buckle and get the pin through the right hole. I prefer **magnetic belts** or
**elastic belts** that are already fixed to the pants. Those designs
remove the need for small, precise hand movements—they make life
simpler and more inclusive. According to Norman, that’s exactly what
human-centered design should do: make the product fit the user, not the

other way around.

Another example is **toothpaste**. Squeezing the tube neatly is messy
for most people, but especially hard for me. Putting the cap back and closing it is
another challenge. A **toothpaste dispenser** solves this problem for everyone. It gives
the right amount, keeps the sink clean, and takes away frustration. That’s not a “lazy”
solution—it
shows how good design can remove the chance of error.

My mom often says, *“A good workman doesn’t blame his tools.”*
That’s what many people are taught in our culture—we’re trained to
adjust, not complain. But Norman helps me see it differently. If
something doesn’t work well for people, the **design** should improve,
not the person.

Finally, I really appreciate tools that plan for recovery. Programs like
**Adobe Creative Cloud** or **Autodesk** save work automatically. Even
if the software crashes, I know I can get my work back. That gives me
confidence to explore new features and take risks. It’s a great example
of **error recovery**, not **error blame**.

---

### In Short

Good design accepts that people make mistakes.
It gives clear feedback, prevents errors when possible, and helps users
recover quickly.

Designers shouldn’t ask people to “just be more careful”—they should
make products that care for the people using them.

## Thought Questions

1. Why do you think so many people blame themselves instead of blaming
bad design when things go wrong?
2. How could small, everyday tools—like belts, toothpaste tubes, or
kitchen items—be redesigned to make life easier for everyone?
3. What features in your favorite apps or tools help you recover when
something goes wrong? How do they make you feel?
