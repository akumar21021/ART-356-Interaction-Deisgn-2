The found interesting is that design has good and bad. 
# Chapter 1 – Reflection on *The Design of Everyday Things*

# Chapter 1 – Reflection on *The Psychopathology of Everyday Things*

In Chapter 1, Don Norman talks about how many everyday things are
confusing to use, like doors, websites, and machines. He says that
when people struggle with these things, it’s usually not their fault.
It’s because the **design is bad**, not the person.

Good design should make it easy to see what you can do and what will
happen when you do it. Norman calls this **discoverability** and
**understanding**. But when things don’t give clear signs, people get
confused and blame themselves. They think they did something wrong,
when really the product didn’t guide them well.

I felt this when I tried to **sell our minivan online**.  
The website was so confusing that I couldn’t even find a simple
category for cars. I didn’t know where my listing went or how to
answer messages. It made me feel like I was doing something wrong,
but now I understand it was just poor design. The website didn’t
match how most people think or look for things.

Another example is **corded headphones**.  
They tangle up so easily, and every time I try to untangle them I get
frustrated. I wish Apple made a version that could **retract** so the
cord wouldn’t get messy. That would make life easier and calmer.

# Chapter 2 – Reflection on *The Psychology of Everyday Actions*

In Chapter 2, Don Norman talks about how people do everyday things.
He says every action has steps: we decide what we want to do, plan it,
try it, see what happens, and decide if it worked. When something is
hard to do, it’s usually because the design doesn’t match how people
actually think or move. That makes us feel like the problem is us,
not the design.

I felt this when I was eating **biryani** at a restaurant.  
The food looked amazing—beautiful layers of rice and spices stacked in
a small shiny bowl filled right to the top. But when I tried to mix it,
it was almost impossible. The spoon was too thin and too short, and
the bowl was too full. I really wanted to enjoy it because the smell
was so good, but I ended up struggling, spilling rice, and feeling
frustrated. I thought, *“Why can’t I do this right?”* But after reading
Norman, I realized it wasn’t me—it was the **design**.

Norman says that when design makes it hard to do something simple,
people often blame themselves. Good design should make the next step
obvious and give us tools that fit what we want to do. In this case, a
**bigger bowl** and a **better serving spoon** would have made mixing
easy and the experience more enjoyable. The fancy look of the small
bowl ignored the real goal—being able to eat comfortably.

This chapter helped me see how much **emotion** is part of design.
When things work smoothly, we feel calm and happy. When they don’t, we
feel awkward or upset. That’s not a personal failure—it just means the
design didn’t think about people’s real needs.

**In short:**  
Good design helps people do things easily and feel good doing them.
Bad design gets in the way and makes people think they’re the problem,
even when they aren’t.
